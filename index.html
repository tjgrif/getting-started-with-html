  <b>What Makes up the Web</b></br>
  <em>The Web</em> is simply a number of servers (computers) connected to each other. They "speak" to each other through <em>HTTP</em> (referred to as a 'protocol'). <br>
  <em>HTML</em> is the language that allows a browser on a computer to interpret and order the files from other serviers on the internet.<br>
</p>

<p>
  <b>HTML</b></br>
  HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. <br> 
  Elements within HTML are called "tags". <br>
  "Tags" instruct the computer to show everthing: from whether a word is <b>bold</b>, <em>italicised</em>, or a <a href= "www.reddit.com">hyperlink</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  <b>Inline v Block</b><br>
  At a simple level, laying-out webpages involves either letting objects or words simply exist on the page "inline" or have an invisible box around them "block".
